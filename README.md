## Web Scrapers

1. #### US_weather.py  
   This script is based on the [datascience.io](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/) web scraping tutorial. I extended the original by allowing users to input latitude and longitude coordinates showing the temperature where they are in the U.S. 

2. #### hot_uk_scraper.py
   This script takes input from the user and queries the hotukdeals.com website. It then scrapes the titles, temperatures, prices and retailers from the first results page, sorts by temp and outputs the data to a [pandas table](https://rawgit.com/ColdView/web_scrapers/master/deals_table.html). Work in progress.

3. #### UK_weather.py
   Basic script to find the current temperature in single location. Planning to extend it using the Met Office DataPoint API.
